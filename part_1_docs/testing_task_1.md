### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    # needs to be == to check if equal to 1
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    # else statement requires a colon
    else
      return False
   

  # should be def not dif
  # need comma between card1 and card2
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    # should be card1, there is no card
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  


def cards_total(self, cards):
  # total not assigned any value
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    # return needs to be out of the for loop, otherwise will end on first result.
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
